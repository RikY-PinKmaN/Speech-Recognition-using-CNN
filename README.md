# Speech-Recognition-using-CNN
For this 1000 samples of different words had been taken to work with. A CNN structure based on ‘googlenet’ was used on the dataset after converting the audio files into spectrograms. To optimize hyperparameters Bayesian Optimization wad used, along with model with model averaging with 5 different models to train the data which in turn increased the validation accuracy.
